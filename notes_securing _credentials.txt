# Notes for securing credentials

# in the Terminal virual environment

# >>> echo "export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID='your ID from the Twilio Console'" > twilio.env

# >>> echo "export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN='your Auth Token from the Twilio Console'" >> twilio.env

# >>> echo â€œexport TWILIO_SMS_FROM='Your Twilio Phone Number from the Twilio Console preceded by a +1 for the US with no parentheses or dashes'" >> 
twilio.env

# Confirm contents

# >>> cat twilio.env

# >>> source ./twilio.env

# Git ignore the file with credentials

# >>> echo "twilio.env" >> .gitignore

# If you are adapting the file from Twilio's sample, make sure to change the SID, AUTH_TOKEN and from fields as shown in the send_sms file, import os and ensure that the names have single quotes around them.

# You should then be able to send a message by using >>> python3 send_sms.py

# make the body and the to phone number parameters in the future then migrate to a web page in a future iteration.
